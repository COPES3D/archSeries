fish.period[!sample==0] gives basically same as zoo.period[CLASS=="fish"&!SAMPLE==0]
	- a little smaller, because indet fish excluded? But same pattern

fish.period, unsubsetted, gives roughly the same but with that post-med spike

BUT creating zoo.sample drops out most of the non-high-med specimens.

What does this mean? Something is going wrong in mergin sample with zoo!
 - numbers aren't matching. Why?

Not all samples represented in zoo... that's normal!
Not all zoo samples in sample list???
	-	specifically, the non-high-med ones missing???

If the sample table is just a list of links between sample and contexts (SITE_S and SITE_C)...
	....more of these links must be in 

0) fish[!SAMPLE==0] --> 6769 records, 1368 samples

a)Linking fish[!SAMPLE==0] to sample by SITE_S  --> 5273 records, 1140 samples --> 4110, 865
b)Linking fish[!SAMPLE==0] to sample by SITE_C  --> 6641 records, 1134 s f fish; 1248 f sample --> 4722, 869/933
c)Linking fish[!SAMPLE==0] to sample by both    --> 4958 records, 1090 samples

d)Linking fish[!SAMPLE==0] direct to context.period by SITE_C --> 5319 records, 1054 samples

So we have 5273-4958=315 records from 1140-1090=50 samples that link by SITE_S but not by SITE_C
+ we have 6641-4958=1683 records from 1134 samples that link link by SITE_C but not by SITE_S

We need to identify sample codes in fish that don't turn up in sample
	- there are 228 of them! Accounting for 1496 records...  6769-5273=1496! Ok, makes sense...
	- 1244 of these records (203 samples) can be linked to context
		--> 19 samples appear in fish but are completely absent from context & sample tables
	- 1209 of these records (189 samples) can be linked to context.period
		--> these are the difference between a and d
		--> 189 samples that relate to documented contexts but are not themselves documented!

So what do we do?
	- option d above for the fish - retains the most data
	- but can we tack the additional samples on to out sample counts?
