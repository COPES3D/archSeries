Description: This package is designed to tackle a common problem in archaeology:
    the integration of information from multiple entities with varying chronological
    resolution and overlapping date ranges. It includes functions for constructing
    overall chronological distributions from tables of start dates, end dates, and
    weights, and for plotting those distributions in various ways. Distributions may
    be calculated either by basic aoristic analysis or by simulation. In the latter
    case, 'dummy sets' can also be calculated automatically based on uniformity or
    on a custom null model. At present the package only supports aoristic analysis/
    simulation based on assumption of uniform probability within date limits, and
    is only designed for frequency data. In future we hope to implement: (a) ability
    to work with radiocarbon dates (e.g. using the Bchron package); (b) ability to
    specify null models other than uniform or custom, and to fit these to the data
    before simulating dummy sets; (c) tools for dealing with data types other than
    frequency, e.g. metrical data.
